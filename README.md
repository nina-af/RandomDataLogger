# RandomDataLogger
An Android app for logging cell signal strength and automatically toggling Airplane Mode on/off when the detected signal falls below the user-set 
threshold in order to encourage the user's phone to reconnect to the cell tower with the strongest signal; intended to maintain a strong signal strength 
for users relying on their phone to provide a mobile hotspot in order to access the internet on other devices.
